<h1>RAGing Knowledge: Powering Answers with Retrieval Augmented Generation</h1>

RAGing Knowledge is an innovative application that harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT-based model and retrieval augmented generation to dig deep into bespoke documents, extracting valuable insights and generating informative articles. We leverage advanced vector search of embeddings to pinpoint the most relevant information from your unique documents, ultimately leading to robust, comprehensive, and concise responses to your queries.

Chat with any document. Advanced document search capabilities. Direct question answering from your knowledge source.

<h2>How Does RAGing Knowledge Work?</h2>

At its core, RAGing Knowledge acts as an intelligent personal assistant that comprehends your personalized document database. Our application first transforms your documents into high-dimensional vectors, creating a rich, searchable space of embeddings. When you ask a question, RAGing Knowledge uses vector search to find relevant document chunks that could contain the answer.

The magic doesn't stop there. RAGing Knowledge then uses these document chunks to construct an informative article, which not only answers your question but also provides you with related context and information. The result is a comprehensive, human-readable response that offers a deep understanding of the topic at hand.

But what if your question ventures into an area not covered by your documents? RAGing Knowledge has you covered. Aware of its own knowledge limitations, our application will transparently tell you when it can't provide an answer based on the available information. No more ambiguous or misleading responses; we value clarity and honesty.
